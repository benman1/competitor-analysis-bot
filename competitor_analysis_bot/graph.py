"""# Competitor Analysis Bot

Overall design:

- Input:
    - Expected: URL for a  product
        - Or maybe a specific product to scope it down
    - Alternatives:
        - company name, “idea” etc.
- Output:
    - List of competing products
        - Name,
        - summary details
        - How they compare to base company
        - List of customers they are marketing towards
    - Recommendations for potential experiments that could be conducted, such as those related to product discovery, positioning experiments, or user experiments, based on the gathered results.
- Flow (kinda similar to perplexity)
    - User provides a url for a product
    - Bot searches and generates a list of features with detailed information (problem it’s trying to solve, who it’s solving this for (customer segments), etc.) for that product
    - **Confirms with user which features/product to analyze**
        - Think we should avoid multiple products rn bcs it’s kinda hard to do like “find competitors for nvidia” vs. “find competitors of CUDA”
    - (branching) For each product, bot does a web search to find competitors for each product
        - MVP: just query expansion from the product description then google/tavily searches or whatever based on key words
    - **(?)** Maybe could include user confirmation on competitors before proceeding here
    - (branching) for each competitor, populate a similar product card with product name, summary, primary target audience, list of customers/potential customers
    - For each card, write 1-3 experiments you could do
    - (merge) For all the competing products/customers rerank to prioritize experiments

### Graph Structure

Nodes (verbs):

- research_company
    - given the url and optionally other description, scrape the website to populate N product cards
    - **Could probably just be a 1-step extraction** for now
- find_competitors
    - Given the product card of the base company, search the web and generate a list of competing products
    - **Could probably be a simple zero-shot agent**
- research_competitor
    - Given the url and description of a competitor, research competing product + generate competitor card:
        - same as product card +
            - Strengths/benefits vs. the base company
            - Weaknesses vs. base company
            - Recommended experiment(s) to run to gain more information about this competitor
            - Extension: (?) Perceived level of competitiveness - llm probably cant do this well/at all, but some way of scoring this based on similarity to base company and perceived quality of service
- prioritize_experiments
    - Given the list of competitor cards and experiments,

**Extensions (wont impelment)**:

- Start mid-way (we already have our product card, we already have competitor information, etc)
- Expand search (for each competing product, do the same search so you can include competitors of competitors in your list)."""
